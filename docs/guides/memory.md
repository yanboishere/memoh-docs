# Bot Memory Management

Memoh's structured long-term memory system allows bots to remember information across multiple conversations, providing contextually relevant and personalized interactions.

## Prerequisites

Before using the **Memory** tab, make sure your bot already has a **Memory Provider** configured.

1. Create a provider from one of the [Memory Providers](../integrations/providers/memory/index.md) (Built-in, Mem0, or OpenViking).
2. Open your bot's **General** tab.
3. Select the provider in the **Memory Provider** field.
4. Click **Save**.

Without a memory provider, the bot will not have an active memory backend configuration.

## Concept: Memory Retrieval

Memories are stored and retrieved through the assigned memory provider. Depending on the provider type, retrieval may use the built-in memory graph, pgvector embeddings, or an external API. When a user sends a message, Memoh finds the most relevant memories and includes them in the bot's runtime context.

This page is about **long-term memory**. It is separate from **session context compaction**, which reduces the prompt footprint of a single conversation session. See [Context Compaction](./compaction.md).

---

## Operations

Manage your bot's memories from the **Memory** tab in the Bot Detail page.

### 1. Creating Memories

- **New Memory**: Manually enter a memory's content in the provided textarea.
- **From Conversation**: Select specific messages from the bot's conversation history to extract into memory.

### 2. Searching and Managing

- **Search**: Filter memories by ID or text content.
- **Edit**: Modify existing memory entries directly in the list.
- **Delete**: Remove memories that are no longer needed.

## Memory Compaction

Over time, long-term memories can accumulate and become redundant. The **Compact** action in the **Memory** tab rewrites the stored memory set itself.

This operation is provider-level memory maintenance. It is useful when you want to:

- merge overlapping memories
- remove stale or low-value entries
- improve retrieval quality by reducing noise

Parameters:

- **Ratio** — Compression ratio such as `0.8`, `0.5`, or `0.3`. Lower values make compaction more aggressive.
- **Decay Days** — Optionally restrict compaction to older memories only.

This is different from [Context Compaction](./compaction.md), which compresses the active prompt for one session rather than rewriting stored memories.

---

## Rebuild

The **Rebuild** feature re-indexes all memories from scratch. This is useful when:

- You have changed the memory provider's embedding model.
- The vector index has become inconsistent.
- You want to re-process all memories with updated settings.

Click **Rebuild** in the Memory tab to start the process. You can monitor the rebuild status in real-time.

---

## Status

The Memory tab shows the current **status** of the memory provider for this bot:

- **Connected** — The memory backend is reachable and operational.
- **Error** — There is an issue with the memory provider configuration or connectivity.

Use the status indicator to quickly verify that the memory system is working before troubleshooting other issues.

---

## Usage Statistics

The Memory tab displays storage usage information:

- **Total Memories** — The number of memory entries stored for this bot.
- **Index Status** — Whether the vector index is up-to-date.

## Memory vs Session Context

Memoh has two different "compaction" concepts:

| Concept | Scope | Where to trigger it | What it changes |
|--------|-------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Memory Compaction** | Long-term memory provider | Memory tab | Rewrites stored memory entries |
| **Context Compaction** | One conversation session | Session status panel or `/compact` | Summarizes older session context for future model calls |

If you are trying to reduce retrieval noise across many conversations, use **Memory Compaction**.

If you are trying to shorten the currently active conversation history, use **Context Compaction**.

## Bot Interaction

- The bot automatically searches and retrieves memories during chat.
- The assigned **Memory Provider** controls the memory backend used by the bot.
- Provider-specific settings (such as embedding model or API keys) are configured in the provider itself — see [Memory Providers](../integrations/providers/memory/index.md).
- Memories provide the long-term knowledge that makes each bot unique to its owner.
