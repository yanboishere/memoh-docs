# About Memoh

Memoh v0.13 is the open-source multi-agent platform. It lets you run multiple AI agents on one machine, with each agent getting its own workspace, browser, network, tools, and long-term memory.

Agents can talk through Telegram, Discord, Slack, Feishu, WeChat, DingTalk, and other channels — and directly in the Memoh app. They can remember context, operate a browser or desktop, call MCP tools, install skills and connectors, run scheduled tasks, and enforce per-bot access rules.

Prefer a managed option instead of operating your own deployment? [Memoh Cloud](https://app.memoh.net) runs the same product as a hosted service.

## Distribution Modes

### Desktop

Desktop is the native client for Memoh Cloud or a self-hosted server. It wraps the same client interface in a native window with a system tray and shortcuts, and can register the computer it runs on as a Computer that bots may use. It does not run a local server.

### Server Deploy

Server Deploy is for always-on shared usage. Use it when Memoh should serve multiple users, keep channels online while your computer is offline, or run as a self-hosted service. The Docker Compose stack includes the backend, web client, database, memory services, and workspace runtime.

## What v0.13 Emphasizes

### Agent Workspaces

Each bot can use an isolated container workspace with files, commands, MCP hosting, network access, a headed browser, and a graphical desktop. Local and desktop setups can also use trusted local workspaces when host-level access is intentional.

### The Client

The client now covers more of the daily product surface: bot setup, sessions, providers, channels, workspace files, terminal and desktop panes, Supermarket, hooks, schedules, access control, and user preferences. v0.13 also includes English, Simplified Chinese, and Japanese UI language support.

### Hooks, Schedules, And Automation

Hooks let bots run small automation rules around supported events, while Schedule keeps recurring work moving without an active chat. Skills and connectors from the Supermarket extend what a bot can do without custom code.

### Access Control

Access control is split between channel-side chat permissions and workspace-side user permissions. Bot owners can allow or block channel members, grant registered users workspace roles, and keep advanced ACL rules for cases that need more precise matching.
